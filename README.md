# Welcome to my Todo List Backend Project!

## This project was built in Visual Studio 2022

## To run the project

* 'git clone <link found on GitHub>'
* `dotnet nuget restore` or, if you're using an IDE (I reccomend visual studio 2022 since that's what this is configured for):
** Solution --> Right click --> restore nuget packages
* `dotnet clean` or build --> Clean Solution
* `dotnet build` or build --> Build Solution
* `dotnet run` or click the https button

## NOTE

### These instructions are tailed for pulling it down locally and running it with Visual Studio 2022, the commands listed are general .NET CLI commands that **should** work.
